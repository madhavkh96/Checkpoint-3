Because of conflicting evidence, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the first accused officer threatened to kill the victim and directed profanities at the victim. Based on the first accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused first officer failed to take proper police action; failed to report an incident to a supervisor and/or the Department; and failed to complete and submit a Tactical Response Report. Based on material evidence that contradicted the statements provided by the first accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that this accused provided a false report.

IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the second and third accused officers directed profanities at the victim, as there was no sufficient corroborating evidence. Based on admissions made by the second and third accused officers, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that they failed to take proper police action; failed to report an incident to a supervisor and/or the Department; failed to complete and submit a Tactical Response Report; and provided a false report. Based on Department records, IPRA recommended a finding of UNFOUNDED for the allegation that the third accused officer was in violation of the Departments medical roll policy.

It is further alleged that a Chicago Police Department officer allegedly failed to screen an individual for suitability for confinement, failed to follow guidelines for arrestee screening, failed to summon medical attention for the individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks, made a false entry in the inspection log, and left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization. Finally, it is alleged that a Chicago Police Department sergeant failed to provide medical care to an individual; and that several Chicago Police Department officers physically mistreated and failed to provide medical care for said individual. Based on internal reports and admissions by the principal accused officer, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN allegations that the accused officer failed to screen the individual for suitability of confinement and that the accused officer failed to follow arrestee screening guidelines. Further, IPRA recommended to find the allegations that the accused officer failed to summon an ambulance for an individual, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and that the accused left his duty assignment without proper relief or authorization, as UNFOUNDED, because the accused officer was given verbal authorization from a commanding officer to leave his tour of duty early, and the alleged incident occurred after the accused officer had already left his tour of duty. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the first accused detention aide, principal to the incident, failed to make fifteen (15) minute checks on the detained individual, made a false entry in the inspection log, and made a false report, because his statements conflicted with internal reports and material evidence. The remaining allegations were recommended to be UNFOUNDED, because corroborating witness statements indicated that the accused detention aide followed orders of the commanding officer to place the detainee in a cell, that the detention aide advised the commanding officer of the detainees physical injuries, and that upon discovering the detainees condition, he notified the commanding officer and requested that an ambulance be called. The allegations against the second accused detention aide were deemed as UNFOUNDED, because it was confirmed that these were not within the purview of his duty assignment on the day of the incident. The allegations against the remaining accused officers that they physically mistreated the detainee and failed to summon medical attention, were deemed as UNFOUNDED because witness statements and internal reports corroborated that the accused officers were not made aware of any physical injuries suffered by the detainee and had minimal contact with the detainee when he was transported to the 11th District lock-up. Finally, the allegation against the accused sergeant that he allegedly failed to summon an ambulance for the detained individual, was SUSTAINED as witness statements supported this allegation. PRA recommended a fifteen (15) day suspension for the first accused detention aide, a sixteen (16) day suspension for the accused sergeant, and a fifteen (15) day suspension for the accused police officer."

The officers had been in an unmarked car, but Mr. knew they were police because of their municipal plates. He asked why he was being detained and denied breaking the law. The three officers grabbed him and placed him in handcuffs. Mr. _complained about the handcuffs being too tight. The officers then performed a test and determined the cuffs were not too tight. The 2 Attachment l9 of?cers searched Mr. person and found several cartons of cigarettes and a small amount of marijuana. Mr. was placed in the back of a marked police vehicle and taken to the station at 63rd and Loomis. At the police station, he asked again what he was in custody for, but no one would talk to him. He was told he would have to speak with his arresting officer.

Chicago Ave. Officer began his statement by requesting to make a correction to Investigator Stop Report ISR Officer _wished to clarify the last sentence in the narrative of the report by adding that the subject was transported to the 007th District. He stated that Mr. was taken to the 007th District station because the officers needed to weigh the amount of cannabis recovered from his person. Additionally, Officer did not possess the correct ticket book to write a citation for cannabis.

That night, he was working with Officer and Officer Throughout their shift, they were in the vicinity of 810 W. 59th St. Officer stated that the convenience store on that corner was a known area for problems such as loitering, drug sales and public intoxication. The business was part of a criminal trespass affidavit program in which a business posts signs about criminal trespass and agrees to a heightened police presence in the area. Officer stated that throughout the shift that evening he and the other officers were driving around 810 W. 59th St., when he witnessed Mr. conducting hand?to? hand transactions in the gas station parking lot on multiple, separate occasions.

At that time Mr. was standing in between the _station and the _next door. The officers then pulled into the lot and approached Mr. Officer _approached Mr. for a field interview and asked for identification. Mr. began fumbling around in his pockets in a manner Officer _nterpreted as evasive. During this time, Officer observed packages of cigarettes in Mr. pockets and Mr. became verbally aggressive.

Officer insisted that during this time, Mr. _was detained but not under arrest. 3 Attachments 30 31 Officer questioned Mr. about dangerous materials or drugs on his person. Mr. admitted to having a bag of marijuana. Officer found a small bag of marijuana during the search. Mr. was not arrested for possession of the marijuana because at that time, marijuana in that small an amount was subject to a civil law citation, which is distinct from an administrative notice of violation. Mr. was placed into separate police vehicle that was called to the scene. Officer car did not have a cage for transport. Officer _ated that they transported Mr. because, while the penalty for under 10 grams of marijuana was a civil law citation, officers on the street at that time were not issued civil law citation books, therefore he had to be taken back to district station where he could be given a ticket. Officer was given the opportunity to watch a segment of his body worn camera footage from that evening in which he can be heard telling Mr. ?You could have just got a ticket.? Of?cer stated that telling him that was a tactic to get him to cooperate. He denied that Mr. defiant language and behavior was a factor in the decision to transport him.

He stated he was checking for contraband. After the searches were complete, Officer - told Officer that they were arresting Mr. for trespassing. They brought Mr. in for the trespass and brought Mr. in for tickets. He stated that once they wrote Mr. _tickets for selling cigarettes and for possession of cannabis, they let him go. He stated that cigarettes selling is arrestable offence depending on the circumstances. The cannabis was a small amount only requiring a citation. He stated that one reason for the transport of Mr. to the station is that the tickets given for cannabis had recently changed and officers in the field were not issued ticket books with the new tickets. Therefore, to write a citation for cannabis, they had to bring Mr. to the district station. Officer stated that he did not write the ISR and his name was only included because he was present. Officer stated he did not recall what information he contributed to the ISR. 4 Attachment 29 On uly19, 2019, Of?cer ?5 gave a statement to COPA at 1615 W.

"On 24 February 2005, a complaint was registered with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA, f/k/a Office of Professional Standards), regarding an incident occurring in the 6th District, involving a then unknown Chicago Police Department officer, who allegedly abused a complainant. This initial investigation was closed because IPRA was not able to obtain a sworn and signed affidavit from the complainant. Upon administrative review, the investigation was re-opened on 11 December 2006. Based on subsequent investigation, IPRA identified separate misconduct and it was alleged that the first accused officer submitted a false Department report and signed another officers name to a Department report without permission. The second accused officer was alleged to have submitted a false Department report, signed another officers name to a Department report without permission, and was aware the misconduct of the first accused officer and failed to report it. Based on the corroborating witness statements from a fellow Department member and on the first accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused officer submitted a false Department report and signed another officers name to a Department report. Again, based on corroborating witness statements from the fellow Department member and the first accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the second accused officer submitted a false Department report. In turn based on said statements and admissions, IPRA found the allegation that the second accused officer signed another officers name to a Department report as UNFOUNDED. Lastly, based on the second accused officers admissions, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that he was aware of the misconduct by the first accused officer and failed to report it.

It is further alleged that one of the accused officers struck the individual in the face. Based on internal reports and witness statements, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations against three (3) principally involved officers that they failed to obtain medical attention for the individual in a timely manner after observing the individual place an unidentified object into his mouth and complained of difficulty breathing, and that the accused officers failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner by failing to provide said attention. In addition, IPRA recommended that an allegation against a fourth accused officer that he allegedly failed to obtain immediate medical attention for a detainee, be UNFOUNDED because witness statements established that he did not witness the individual put the object in his mouth and therefore was not aware of the need for medical attention, and also he said that he had, as a matter of course, offered medical attention and it was declined. For allegations against those officers alleged to have been witnesses to the mistreatment of the individual and to have failed to report any misconduct and failed to conduct themselves in a professional manner, IPRA recommend to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations because witness statements were inconsistent and could not establish their presence when any misconduct occurred. Further, IPRA recommended a ten (10) day suspension for each of the three principally accused members."

Because the complaining victim recanted statements that the accused member allegedly struck her about the face and verbally abused the victim, IPRA recommended that these allegations be UNFOUNDED. IPRA recommended that the allegation that the accused member allegedly allowed her firearm to be released into the possession of another Department member, be UNFOUNDED, because there was insufficient evidence to substantiate any misconduct in this action.

Further IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused member was intoxicated and failed to notify the Department that she was served with an Order of Protection, based on reports generated from her arrest for and criminal case for simple battery.

Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused sergeant verbally abused another victim by calling her a derogatory term in Spanish, based on corroborating witness statements.

In addition, the victim further alleged that on separate occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer. There were conflicting statements between the accused and the victim, and there were no independent witnesses to corroborate either account, therefore IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegation that the accused member threatened to kill the victim.

Although the victim requested police escort in order to remove her personal items from the accuseds apartment, the victim did not show up to do so and IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused did not return the victims personal items and that he destroyed her clothes and shoes, because no independent witnesses were revealed to corroborate these allegations. Because C.P.D. records substantiated that the accused member used his department user ID and password to obtain a copy of the victims criminal history, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN the allegations that the accused used his official position for personal gain/influence and that the accused associated/fraternized with a convicted felon, in that he maintained an intimate relationship with the victim after he knew her criminal history. Further, IPRA recommended to SUSTAIN an additional allegation that the accused officer provided a false report in that he denied having knowledge that the victim was a convicted felon and denied accessing her criminal history. Because there were no records of 911 calls reporting domestic disturbances at the subject location on the dates alleged by the victim, and because various witnesses disclosed by the victim did not cooperate with IPRAs investigation and could not corroborate the allegations that on several occasions, unidentified Chicago Police Department officers failed to provide proper police service, failed to offer her medical attention and joked about the domestic altercations between her and the accused officer, IPRA recommended to NOT SUSTAIN these allegations.

After approximately one hour of talking with Subject 1, Officer A radioed for a supervisor. Sergeant A responded and was apprised of the situation.
